## About Page

Let’s create an “About” page. We’ll use this page to demonstrate how page navigation works in Next.js.

Create a file called `about.js` inside the `pages` directory and add the following:

```jsx
const About = () => <h1>About</h1>;

export default About;
```

You can view this page by going to [http://localhost:3000/about](http://localhost:3000/about) in the browser.

This is how you can create different pages in Next.js. Simply create a JS file in the `pages` directory, and the file name becomes the URL path. In a way, this is similar to building websites using HTML or PHP files.

Now, let’s add a link to each page so you can go back and forth between the index page and the about page.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
