import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout';

export const meta = {
  title: 'Dynamic Routing',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'dynamic-routing',
  stepId: 'setup'
};

### Setup (Optional)

**If youâ€™re continuing from the previous lesson,** you can skip the following and go straight to the next page.

Otherwise, you can download, install, and run the starter code below. Again, this is NOT necessary if youâ€™ve just finished the previous lesson.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeit/next-learn-demo.git
cd next-learn-demo
cd 2-dynamic-routing
npm install
npm run dev
```

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
