import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout';

export const meta = {
  title: 'Dynamic Routing',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'dynamic-routing'
};

So far, we’ve created two pages with specific routes: `/` and `/about`.

As mentioned in the beginning, we’d like to create a blog app. So we’d like to support <strong>dynamic routes</strong> like below:

- `/posts/first-post` should display the first blog post.
- `/posts/second-post` should display the second blog post.

So if the path looks like with `/posts/[slug]`, it should show a blog post that corresponds to `slug`.

Let’s take a look at how we can implement dynamic routes in Next.js!

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
